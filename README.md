# Word Count â€“ Count Words in a Line of Text

This repository contains a Go program that reads a line of text from the user and counts the number of words in that line.

The project follows the [golang-standards/project-layout](https://github.com/golang-standards/project-layout) for organizing Go projects.


- `cmd/main.go`: The entry point of the application.
- `internal/wordcount/counter.go`: Contains the logic to count words.
- `internal/wordcount/counter_test.go`: Unit tests for the word counting function.
